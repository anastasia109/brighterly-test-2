                <h3 class="about-info__title">U.S. students‚Äô academic achievement still lags that of their peers in
                    many other countries</h3>
                <p>How do U.S. students compare with their peers around the world? Recently released data from
                    international
                    math and science assessments indicate that U.S. students continue to rank around the middle of
                    the
                    pack,
                    and behind many other advanced industrial nations.<br>
                    One of the biggest cross-national tests is the Programme for International Student Assessment
                    (PISA),
                    which every three years measures reading ability, math and science literacy and other key skills
                    among
                    15-year-olds in dozens of developed and developing countries. The most recent PISA results, from
                    2015,
                    placed the U.S. an unimpressive 38th out of 71 countries in math and 24th in science. Among the
                    35
                    members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which sponsors the PISA
                    initiative, the U.S. ranked 30th in math and 19th in science.
                </p>
                <p>Younger American students fare somewhat better on a similar cross-national assessment, the Trends
                    in
                    International Mathematics and Science Study. That study, known as TIMSS, has tested students in
                    grades
                    four and eight every four years since 1995. In the most recent tests, from 2015, 10 countries
                    (out
                    of 48
                    total) had statistically higher average fourth-grade math scores than the U.S., while seven
                    countries
                    had higher average science scores. In the eighth-grade tests, seven out of 37 countries had
                    statistically higher average math scores than the U.S., and seven had higher science scores.
                </p>
                <p>Another long-running testing effort is the National Assessment of Educational Progress, a project
                    of
                    the
                    federal Education Department. In the most recent NAEP results, from 2015, average math scores
                    for
                    fourth- and eighth-graders fell for the first time since 1990. A team from Rutgers University is
                    analyzing the NAEP data to try to identify the reasons for the drop in math scores.
                </p>
                <p>The average fourth-grade NAEP math score in 2015 was 240 (on a scale of 0 to 500), the same level
                    as
                    in
                    2009 and down from 242 in 2013. The average eighth-grade score was 282 in 2015, compared with
                    285 in
                    2013; that score was the lowest since 2007. (The NAEP has only tested 12th-graders in math four
                    times
                    since 2005; their 2015 average score of 152 on a 0-to-300 scale was one point lower than in 2013
                    and
                    2009.)<br>
                    Looked at another way, the 2015 NAEP rated 40% of fourth-graders, 33% of eighth-graders and 25%
                    of
                    12th-graders as ‚Äúproficient‚Äù or ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù in math. While far fewer fourth- and eighth-graders
                    now
                    rate
                    at ‚Äúbelow basic,‚Äù the lowest performance level (18% and 29%, respectively, versus 50% and 48% in
                    1990),
                    improvement in the top levels appears to have stalled out. (Among 12th-graders, 38% scored at
                    the
                    lowest
                    performance level in math, a point lower than in 2005.)
                </p>
                <p>NAEP also tests U.S. students on science, though not as regularly, and the limited results
                    available
                    indicate some improvement. Between 2009 and 2015, the average scores of both fourth- and
                    eight-graders
                    improved from 150 to 154 (on a 0-to-300 scale), although for 12th-graders the average score
                    remained
                    at
                    150. In 2015, 38% of fourth-graders, 34% of eighth-graders and 22% of 12th-graders were rated
                    proficient
                    or better in science; 24% of fourth-graders, 32% of eighth-graders and 40% of 12th-graders were
                    rated
                    ‚Äúbelow basic.‚Äù
                </p>
                <p>These results likely won‚Äôt surprise too many people. In a 2015 Pew Research Center report, only
                    29%
                    of
                    Americans rated their country‚Äôs K-12 education in science, technology, engineering and
                    mathematics
                    (known as STEM) as above average or the best in the world. Scientists were even more critical: A
                    companion survey of members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science found
                    that
                    just
                    16% called U.S. K-12 STEM education the best or above average; 46%, in contrast, said K-12 STEM
                    in
                    the
                    U.S. was below average.
